# Logistic Matrix Factorization

> This is a self-implemented repository for the paper **[Logistic matrix factorization for implicit feedback data](http://web.stanford.edu/~rezab/nips2014workshop/submits/logmat.pdf)**.

Moreover, I've implemented the log confidence function besides linear confidence function.

**Requirements**

```
Python                    3.8.13
NumPy                     1.23.1
PyTorch                   1.10.2
```

The codes runs well with these requirements. While the codes are simple, so I believe it will also run well with some higher or lower versions of these packages.

**Usage**

Usage is simple, just run:

```
$ python entry.py
```

then everything goes well.
